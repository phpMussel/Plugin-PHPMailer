### v3.0.0

[2020.07.20; Maikuolan] First stable release for the phpMussel-PHPMailer linker.

__*Why "v3.0.0" instead of "v1.0.0?"*__ Because the linker is intended for use with phpMussel v3, and development began at the same time as (and alongside), I've opted to start at *v3.0.0*, in order to avoid confusion with components intended for earlier versions of phpMussel, which have similar names and purpose.

### v3.1.0

[2020.12.04; Maikuolan]: Maintenance release (dependencies update, repository cleanup, etc).

### v3.1.1

[2021.03.03; Maikuolan]: Maintenance release.

### v3.1.2

[2021.05.22; Security; Maikuolan]: Increasing PHPMailer version constraints from ^6.2 to ^6.4.1 due to CVE-2020-36326.
